Machine Learning:

1) Supervised Learning
  - Regression Model:
  - Classification Model:
    A) Logistic Regression
    B) K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
    C) Randon Forest Classifier
    D) Bayes Classifier
    E) Decision Tree

2) Unsupervised Learning

3) Tips:
* For tunning, you can use hyperparameters
* Remember to evaluate your model
* Remember the confusion matrix

4) Steps Suggested:
  4.1. Problem Definition: What problem are we trying to solve?
  4.2. Data: What data do we have?
  4.3. Evaluation: What defines sucess?
  4.4. Features: What features should we model?
  4.5. Modeling: What kind of model should we use?
  4.6. Experiments: What have we tried / what else can we try?

5) Mottos:
  5.1. If in doubt, run the code
  5.2. Experiment, experiment, experiment
  5.3. Visualize, visualize, visualize
  5.4. 
  5.5.
